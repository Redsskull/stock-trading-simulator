## üìö Project Origins & Evolution

This project began as an enhancement of CS50's Finance problem set, where students build a basic stock trading web application. Inspired by the learning opportunity, I transformed the foundational concept into a modern, production-ready application that demonstrates advanced web development techniques.

**What started as a classroom exercise became a showcase of:**
- Modern Python web development with Flask
- Professional database management with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Responsive frontend design with Bootstrap 5
- Dynamic user interactions with JavaScript
- Production-ready development practices

While the original concept of a stock trading simulator came from the CS50 curriculum, the implementation you see here has been rebuilt from the ground up using modern frameworks and best practices.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Redsskull/stock-trading-simulator.git
   cd stock-trading-simulator
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key_here
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   ```

5. **Initialize database**
   ```bash
   flask db init
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

6. **Launch application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
   - Register a new account to begin trading

## üí° Learning Highlights

## üìù Acknowledgments
This project originated from Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course, specifically the Finance problem set. The transformation from a basic classroom exercise into a modern, production-ready application was greatly inspired by Brian Yu's CS50W (Web Programming with Python and JavaScript) lectures, particularly his teachings on:

Django Models & Migrations - Applied these concepts to Flask with SQLAlchemy
Modern JavaScript Techniques - Enhanced user experience with dynamic interactions
Professional Web Development Practices - Database design, security, and project structure

While the core concept of a stock trading simulator came from the CS50 curriculum, this implementation represents a complete modernization influenced by CS50W's advanced web development principles.
Original Concept: CS50's Finance Problem Set
Technical Inspiration: Brian Yu's CS50W lectures on Django and JavaScript
Implementation & Enhancements: Independent development showcasing modern web development practices
The journey from classroom exercise to production-ready application demonstrates the power of taking educational foundations and building upon them with real-world development practices learned from both CS50 and CS50W.
